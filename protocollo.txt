Investigation Title	A transcriptome analysis study with the focus on the role of long non-coding RNAs in Down syndrome subjects
Experiment Description	Down syndrome (DS) results from trisomy of chromosome 21 and is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability (ID). A wide range of comorbidities have been described in DS, such as ID, muscle weakness, hypotonia, congenital heart disease and autoimmune diseases. The pathogenetic mechanisms that are responsible for developing these comorbidities are still far from being understood.  It was hypothesized that dosage imbalance on chromosome 21 as a whole disrupts diverse developmental pathways whereas another hypothesis suggests that dosage increase for specific genes on chromosome 21 contributes  directly to different aspects of the phenotype in DS. The present study explored mRNAs and lncRNAs expression by using the next generation sequencing analysis (NGS) and the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay for the confirmation of the NGS results, followed by functional analysis of the results. The enrichment analysis of the results obtained revealed various pathways in which differentially expressed genes are involved. Developmental disorders play a crucial role in the phenotype of people with Down syndrome with particular attention to intellectual developmental disorders.

Protocol Description	PBMCs separation was performed by using the Ficoll-Paque (Ficoll Plaque PLUS â€“ GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, USA) and the RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (TRIzol Reagent, Invitrogen Life Tecnologies, Carlsband, CA, USA), according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. 	For RNA extraction, each whole blood sample (approx. 10 ml) was processed within 2 hours of collection and the RNA was stored at -80 Â°C.	Indexed libraries were prepared from 1 Âµg/ea purified RNA with TruSeq Stranded mRNA (Illumina) Library Prep Kit, according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. 	Libraries were sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq 550 Dx System (Illumina) in a 2x75 paired-end format.	The read-count for the genes of interest was normalized, considering all genes expressed in the samples, using DESeq2, with standard parameter. using the median of ratio, to perform the differential expression analysis.  In particular the counts were divided by sample-specific size factors determined by median ratio of gene counts relative to geometric mean per gene.
